## Dataset
BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

We used the BraTS2019 dataset ([kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debobratachakraborty/brats2019-dataset), [CBICA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2019/data.html)) to conduct the study.
